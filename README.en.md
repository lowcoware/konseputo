# konseputo

An anti-overengineering engineering skill suite for Claude Code — 22 skills
covering backend (Go-first microservices, Python where it earns it),
frontend (Vue 3 / Nuxt 4), diff review, technical debt, humanized writing,
docs, project management, legacy code, AI/RAG infrastructure, security,
devops, mobile, brainstorming, systematic debugging, and dependency
auditing. For engineers who want a ladder against speculative complexity,
not a framework: a non-negotiable day-one baseline, `konseputo:` ceiling markers
in place of speculative code, and one-line diff review. Native to Claude
Code; portable to Cursor, Codex, and Antigravity CLI via the installer.

## Install

The primary path depends on the tool: Claude Code and Antigravity use their
own plugin systems; Cursor and Codex use `npx skills` (the open agent-skills
installer, vercel-labs/skills).

| CLI | Install (primary path) | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | plugin: `/plugin marketplace add lowcoware/konseputo` then `/plugin install konseputo@konseputo` (adds hooks, statusline, modes) | `INSTALL.en.md` |
| Cursor | `npx skills add lowcoware/konseputo -a cursor` | `INSTALL.en.md` |
| Codex | `npx skills add lowcoware/konseputo -a codex` | `INSTALL.en.md` |
| Antigravity | plugin: `agy plugin install lowcoware/konseputo` | `INSTALL.en.md` |

`npx skills` also works for Claude Code / Antigravity, but drops the bare
skill level without the plugin wiring. No-npx alternative — the repo
installer, `node scripts/install.js --help`.

Hooks, the statusline badge, and `/konseputo-*` activation commands are
Claude-Code-only — the other three CLIs (and a bare copy) auto-attach the
same skill content by description; see `INSTALL.en.md` for what does and
doesn't port per target.

## Quickstart (Claude Code)

1. `/plugin marketplace add lowcoware/konseputo` then `/plugin install konseputo@konseputo`.
2. Restart the session.
3. `/konseputo-help`.

## Skills

All 22 skills and how to invoke them. The `/konseputo-*` commands are Claude
Code; on other CLIs the same skills auto-attach by description. Live
one-screen card: `/konseputo-help`.

| Skill | Command | For |
|---|---|---|
| konseputo | `/konseputo` | Universal router: describe a situation, it names the best-fit konseputo skill to plug in and disambiguates the overlapping pairs |
| konseputo-backend | `/konseputo-backend [mode]` | Greenfield microservice backends, Go-first: ladder, day-one baseline, ceiling markers |
| konseputo-frontend | `/konseputo-frontend [mode]` | Vue 3 / Nuxt 4 / Tailwind v4: register split, AI-tells bans, GSAP/Lenis canon, DESIGN.md protocol |
| konseputo-review | `/konseputo-review` | Diff review: overengineering, baseline, seams, AI-typical bugs, architecture decay, AI-tells — one line per finding |
| konseputo-debt | `/konseputo-debt` | Harvest `konseputo:` markers into a ledger, flag rot |
| konseputo-humanizer | `/konseputo-humanize` | Writes/rewrites text in the calibrated user voice, strips written AI-tells (also automatic during doc generation) |
| konseputo-md-generator | `/konseputo-md` | Formats docs as Obsidian Flavored Markdown — properties, wikilinks, callouts, zero plugins |
| konseputo-artifact | `/konseputo-artifact` | Self-contained HTML artifact generator: report/plan/diagram as one file, mandatory dark mode |
| konseputo-wiki | `/konseputo-wiki` | Maintains a project wiki in Obsidian: structure, MOCs, vault health, Canvas diagrams, Bases views, CLI |
| konseputo-project-management | `/konseputo-pm` | Spec-driven workflow, ADR lifecycle, review-cadence scaling, mechanical playbooks |
| konseputo-legacy | `/konseputo-legacy` | Existing/unfamiliar code: characterization tests, seams, blast-radius, Strangler Fig, agent read-before-write |
| konseputo-ai | `/konseputo-ai` | RAG/embeddings/Qdrant, LLM gateway, MCP server/tool design + security, Claude Code subagent conventions |
| konseputo-security | `/konseputo-security` | JWT/HMAC auth, secrets, IDOR/authz, layered rate limiting, CORS, Traefik edge hardening |
| konseputo-devops | `/konseputo-devops` | Compose multi-env, multi-stage Dockerfiles, GH Actions (pull_request_target footgun), Traefik ACME/TLS, blue-green on one VPS |
| konseputo-mobile | `/konseputo-mobile` | Flutter/React Native/native: platform-choice ladder, day-one mobile baseline, dispose/leak catalog, secrets-in-binary rule |
| konseputo-brainstorm | `/konseputo-brainstorm` | Hard-to-reverse decision: 3 real approaches, score vs named constraints, recommend + trip-wire → ADR |
| konseputo-systematic-debug | `/konseputo-debug` | Disciplined bug hunt: reproduce → bisect → hypothesis-log → smallest fix → regression test |
| konseputo-dependency-audit | `/konseputo-audit` | Vet a dep for CVEs/typosquat/protestware/install-hooks; lockfile+pin discipline |
| konseputo-shrink | `/konseputo-shrink` | Repo-wide over-engineering audit (not a diff): what to delete/replace with stdlib, ranked biggest cut first |
| konseputo-clone | `/konseputo-clone` | Website cloning as a discipline: recon-first, L1-L6 grading, Playwright harvest/mirror/diff scripts, fidelity audit |
| konseputo-goal | `/konseputo-goal` | Execution engine: after the PM phase, drives a plan through phases under one `/goal` — verify, 3-strike recovery, final audit against the plan |
| konseputo-help | `/konseputo-help` | One-screen card: skills, modes, config |

## Modes

A mode (`blitz|medium|hardcore`) is a speed/strictness switch — only
backend and frontend take one. Every other skill in the table above just
runs on its command, no mode. blitz = fastest excellent attempt; medium =
full ruleset (default); hardcore = architecture first (boundaries,
contracts, every seam's failure modes before code).

Activate: `/konseputo-backend [blitz|medium|hardcore]`, `/konseputo-frontend [blitz|medium|hardcore]`.
Deactivate: `stop konseputo` (or `normal mode`). Config:
`~/.config/konseputo/config.json` (`defaultMode`, `docstringLang`,
`coverageTarget`) — full reference card: `/konseputo-help`.

## Usage across CLIs

How you invoke skills depends on the tool: in Claude Code (plugin) —
`/konseputo-*` slash commands plus modes, hooks, and a statusline; in Cursor /
Codex / Antigravity and a bare Claude Code copy, the same skills attach by
description and you name the mode in the prompt. Full per-tool guide —
`USAGE.en.md`, per-tool install — `INSTALL.en.md`.

| CLI | Invoke by | Commands / modes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code (plugin) | `/konseputo-*` or describing the task | commands, modes, hooks, statusline |
| Claude Code (copy) | describing the task | none — mode by words |
| Cursor | describing the task | none — mode by words |
| Codex | describing the task (+ `AGENTS.md`) | none — mode by words |
| Antigravity | describing the task (+ rules) | none — mode by words |

## Linters

`node scripts/check-skills.js && node scripts/check-sync.js && node scripts/konseputo-debt.js`
— frontmatter schema, size caps, cross-reference integrity, and
compact-ruleset drift. Same three gate CI (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`) on
every push and PR.

## Companion skills

konseputo covers anti-overengineering engineering. Worth installing alongside it,
each owning something konseputo deliberately does not duplicate:

- **caveman** — [JuliusBrussee/caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman).
  A compressed-communication mode: the agent drops filler and answers tight,
  keeping code, commands, and errors byte-for-byte exact. konseputo borrows its
  thinking-compression style, but the communication mode itself lives in
  caveman — install it to save output tokens on every reply.
- **claude-bughunter** — [elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter](https://github.com/elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter).
  Offensive security: bug bounty and external red-team, 48 hunt-skills built
  from disclosed reports plus M365/Okta/vCenter attack matrices. konseputo-security
  and konseputo-dependency-audit own the DEFENSIVE, build-time side; bughunter owns
  the offensive side. Install it when the work is an authorized pentest or bug
  bounty, not development.
- **agent-reach** — [Panniantong/Agent-Reach](https://github.com/Panniantong/Agent-Reach).
  Internet access for the agent: a router across 15 platforms (Twitter,
  Reddit, YouTube, Xiaohongshu, Bilibili, LinkedIn, and more), multi-backend,
  cookie-based access, video transcription. konseputo is about engineering code,
  not fetching content from the web — install it when the agent needs to
  research/read the internet, not write code.
- **i-have-adhd** — [ayghri/i-have-adhd](https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd).
  Output shaped for an ADHD reader: lead with the action, numbered steps,
  state restated every turn, concrete time estimates, no preamble or "hope
  this helps." Same class as caveman — an overlay on response style, not
  engineering; konseputo pulled its debug-spiral trigger (konseputo-systematic-debug)
  and pre-send checklist (shared/communication.md), but the full mode lives
  here.
- **obsidian-mind** — [breferrari/obsidian-mind](https://github.com/breferrari/obsidian-mind).
  A whole Obsidian vault as the agent's long-term memory: lifecycle hooks
  (SessionStart context injection, per-message classification, write-time
  frontmatter/wikilink validation), nine subagents for heavy vault operations,
  and a graph-first note discipline. It vendors
  [kepano/obsidian-skills](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills)
  (obsidian-markdown, obsidian-bases, json-canvas, obsidian-cli, defuddle) plus
  its own mermaid/excalidraw/qmd skills, and installs via
  [shardmind](https://github.com/breferrari/shardmind). konseputo-wiki and
  konseputo-md-generator own the project-wiki discipline and Obsidian FORMATTING
  of generated docs; obsidian-mind owns the personal-vault SYSTEM around them —
  install it when the vault is the memory, not just an output format.
