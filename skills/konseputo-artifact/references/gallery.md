# Gallery — vendored example artifacts

21 self-contained HTML files under `examples/` — the reference gallery for
this skill. All are Anthropic's own "unreasonable effectiveness of HTML"
sample gallery (Apache-2.0), plus one architecture-diagram exemplar from
plannotator/effective-html (MIT). Vendored directly (not linked out) because
the whole point is opening them and matching style, density, and tone —
a pointer to a clone rotates its content behind your back.

Open a file in a browser to see it render; the code is what to imitate, the
render is what to match.

Genre column maps to `genres.md`'s three modes — use it to pick the closest
starting point, not as a hard category. The shared token/color/component
system underneath 20 of these 21 files is extracted in `palette.md` —
start there for the visual system, use this index to find the nearest
layout precedent.

## Sample-data honesty

Every example uses fictional data — the placeholder brand "Acme", made-up
metrics, invented PRs. Match the STRUCTURE and visual craft, never copy a
literal number or name into a real artifact (ai-tells.md's fake-precise-
numbers ban applies here exactly as it does anywhere else in konseputo).
