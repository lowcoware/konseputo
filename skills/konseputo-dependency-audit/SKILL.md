# konseputo-dependency-audit

Every dep is code you didn't write running with your privileges. This skill
gates what enters the tree and re-checks what's already in it. Pairs with
`konseputo-backend/references/deps.md` (the blessed-dep *ladder* — should we add one
at all) — this skill answers *is this specific one safe*.

## Two moments it fires

1. **Before adding** — the ladder said "yes, a dep" (YAGNI → reuse → stdlib →
   platform-primitive → dep, all failed). Now vet the specific package.
2. **Periodically** — CVEs land in deps you already trust. Scheduled scan +
   scan in CI (see `konseputo-devops/references/ci.md`).

## Vet-before-add checklist

Run before the first `import`. Any red = justify loudly or pick another.

1. **Name is exact.** Typosquat check — `reqeusts`, `python-sqlite`,
   `crossenv`, `electorn`. Copy the name from official docs, never type it from
   memory. (PyPI/npm typosquatting is a routine attack vector.)
2. **It's the real package.** Right repo, right author, matches the docs link.
   Dependency-confusion: an internal name published to a public registry gets
   pulled preferentially — scope/namespace internal packages.
3. **Alive.** Recent commits, releases, issues answered. Abandoned = unpatched
   CVEs waiting.
4. **Proportionate tree.** `npm i one-liner` that drags 40 transitive deps →
   the `left-pad`/`is-even` tax. Prefer stdlib or a small vetted dep. Check the
   transitive count before committing.
5. **No unexplained install hooks.** `postinstall`/`preinstall` scripts, build
   steps that fetch remote code — the classic malware delivery path. Read them.
6. **Known-vuln scan.** `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / `govulncheck` / `osv-scanner`
   against the exact version. Advisory open + no fix → don't adopt.
7. **License fits.** Copyleft (GPL/AGPL) in a proprietary service is a legal
   CVE. Check before, not after.

Load `references/supply-chain.md` when actually auditing (any new dep, periodic
audit, incident) — attack catalog, scanners per stack, lockfile rules, real
incidents.

## Hard rules

1. **Lock, don't hard-pin direct deps.** Commit the lockfile always — it
   freezes the WHOLE graph (direct + transitive), which is the actual
   defense against a silently-hijacked patch. Hard-pinning the direct
   dependency itself in the manifest (exact version instead of `^`/`~`) is
   a separate move, and a CMU empirical study found it backfires: pinning
   direct deps measurably increases the cost of carrying vulnerable/outdated
   versions and can even increase exposure to malicious updates, because the
   deliberate manual bump (when it finally happens) isn't graph-verified any
   more carefully than an automated one would have been. Prefer a narrow
   floating range (`^`/`~`, patch-or-minor) on direct deps + the committed
   lockfile for reproducibility + Renovate/Dependabot proposing bumps as
   reviewable PRs, not auto-merge. Containers/OCI images are the exception —
   pin those to a digest; the CMU finding is about language-ecosystem
   package managers with lockfiles, not image references.
   [Pinning Is Futile, arXiv:2502.06662 (FSE'25)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06662)
2. **Read install scripts of anything new.** One `postinstall` audit is cheaper
   than one credential exfil.
3. **Scan in CI, not just locally.** A vuln that lands after merge needs to
   surface on the next build (`konseputo-devops` CI gate).
4. **Minimize the tree.** Fewer deps = smaller attack surface. Every transitive
   dep is trust you extended without asking.
5. **A CVE in a dep is your bug.** "Upstream's problem" ships the vuln to your
   users regardless. Own it: patch, pin-back, or replace.

## Boundaries

- Should we add a dep *at all* (the ladder) → `konseputo-backend/references/deps.md`.
- Runtime secrets/authz/edge hardening → `konseputo-security`.
- Wiring the scan into the pipeline → `konseputo-devops/references/ci.md`.
- "stop konseputo" / "normal mode": revert to default behavior.
