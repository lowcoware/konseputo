# konseputo-legacy

`konseputo-backend`/`konseputo-frontend` assume you're building something new. This
skill assumes the opposite: the code already exists, you didn't write it,
and you don't yet know what it actually does — only what it's supposed to
do. **Legacy code = code without tests**, full stop (Feathers) — age and
ugliness are irrelevant to that definition; a beautiful function written
yesterday with no test is legacy the moment someone else has to change it
blind.

## The one rule everything else follows

**Understand before you touch, prove you understood before you refactor.**
A confident agent editing code it hasn't actually traced is the single
biggest source of legacy-code incidents — worse than a cautious human,
because confidence doesn't correlate with correctness here. Concretely:

1. Read the function/module fully before editing it.
2. State what you believe it does, its callers, and what you might break —
   in the chat response, before the diff. This is a forcing function, not
   ceremony: writing it down surfaces wrong assumptions while they're still
   cheap to correct.
3. If there's no test pinning current behavior, write one FIRST (a
   characterization test — records what the code does now, not what it
   should do) — then refactor with that test as a tripwire.

Full detail on each step: `references/characterization.md` (tests/seams),
`references/blast-radius.md` (assessment before editing),
`references/agent-protocol.md` (the read-analyze-explain-propose-stop loop itself).

## Safe-refactor sequence — the one order that actually works

`characterize current behavior → get a test in place (any test, even a
golden-master) → refactor in small steps with the test as tripwire.`

The reliably wrong order — refactor first, "test" only by manual poking
afterward — is rewriting with extra steps, not refactoring. If you catch
yourself about to change structure before a test exists, stop.

## Boy Scout Rule — bounded, not open season

"Leave it better than you found it" applies **only inside the file/function
already being touched for the actual task** — rename a bad local var, fix
an obvious local smell you already had to read anyway. Cleanup that expands
the diff to files/functions the agent hasn't already characterized gets
split into its own separate task, never bundled with a behavior change —
mixing the two makes a diff unreviewable and risks a bug in code nobody
was actually trying to change.

## Incremental modernization — Strangler Fig

For migrating a whole module/service, not one function: route/facade in
front of old + new, shift traffic gradually, and — the step everyone
skips — **explicitly track deletion of the old path as its own task**, not
an implied someday. A migration that reaches 90% traffic on the new path
and stops there isn't done; it's now two systems forever. Full pattern,
failure mode, and real rewrite case studies (Netscape's 3-year freeze,
what the successful rewrites did differently): `references/strangler-fig.md`.

## References — load on demand

| File | Covers | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| references/characterization.md | characterization tests, seams, Feathers' dependency-breaking techniques, safe-refactor sequence detail | any refactor of untested code |
| references/blast-radius.md | 6-step assessment workflow, feature-flag exposure limiting, grep-every-caller discipline | before any edit in unfamiliar code |
| references/strangler-fig.md | incremental migration pattern, classic failure mode, real rewrite case studies | migrating/replacing a whole module or service |
| references/agent-protocol.md | the read→analyze→explain→propose→stop loop, comprehension-debt, why agents specifically fail here differently than humans | working in any codebase the agent didn't write this session |

## Boundaries

- Once characterized and tested, `konseputo-backend`/`konseputo-frontend`'s ladder
  and baseline apply normally to the new code — this skill governs the
  transition, not a permanent different ruleset.
- Correctness bugs found while characterizing → note them, don't silently
  fix them mid-characterization (a characterization test documents CURRENT
  behavior, bugs included; fixing during pinning defeats the point).
  Separate task for the actual bug fix.
- Architecture-decay findings (`konseputo-review`'s `arch:` tag) apply the same
  way here as in greenfield code — legacy status doesn't exempt a hot
  partition key from being flagged.
- "stop konseputo" / "normal mode": revert to default behavior.
