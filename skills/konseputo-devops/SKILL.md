# konseputo-devops

Deploy and infra for the blessed stack: Docker Compose multi-env + Traefik +
GitHub Actions, no Kubernetes (banned). Same
anti-overengineering, incident-cited style as konseputo-backend. This skill is the
"how to ship it" layer under `konseputo-backend`'s baseline and `observability.md`.

## The one principle

Config that isn't in git, and infra that isn't pruned, both rot silently
until they're an incident. Every rule here pushes config into version control
and makes drift/decay visible before it bites.

## References — load on demand

| File | Covers | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| references/compose.md | multi-env layout, `secrets:`, healthcheck `depends_on`, env-drift trap | writing/reviewing Compose files |
| references/dockerfile.md | multi-stage Go/Python, non-root, cache-order, `.dockerignore`, digest pins | writing a Dockerfile |
| references/ci.md | build/test/lint gate, SSH auto-deploy, health gate, `pull_request_target` exfil footgun | GitHub Actions workflow |
| references/cert-tls.md | Traefik ACME resolvers, challenge types, rate limits, renewal-failure alerting | edge TLS / cert automation |
| references/deploy.md | rolling restart, blue-green on one VPS, migration ordering, rollback | deploying / a deploy script |
| references/decay.md | orphaned volumes, image bloat, cert-expiry blind spots, `.env` drift | periodic infra hygiene |
| references/incident.md | prod outage: mitigate-first (rollback/flag), blast-radius, RCA handoff, blameless post-mortem | prod is down or degraded |
| references/backup.md | RPO/RTO tiers, pg_dump vs WAL-G, restore drills, per-store methods, live-volume trap, dead-man's-switch monitoring | setting up or auditing backups |
| references/loadtest.md | k6 thresholds/executors, coordinated omission, finding the knee, DB-pool-first bottleneck, CI wiring | load testing / capacity question |
| [../../shared/context7.md](../../shared/context7.md) | Traefik label/ACME/GH Actions syntax before writing against it — version drift past training cutoff | unfamiliar Traefik middleware or Actions syntax |

## Boundaries

- Secret *storage* tiers (`.env` → Compose `secrets:` → SOPS → manager) →
  `konseputo-security/references/secrets.md`. This skill owns the *wiring flow*
  (GH secret → container), that one owns which tier for which sensitivity.
- Traefik rate-limit/CORS/header middleware + Traefik CVEs →
  `konseputo-security/references/edge.md`. This skill owns cert automation +
  routing labels.
- Observability stack wiring → `konseputo-backend/references/observability.md`.
- Zero-downtime DB migration mechanics → `konseputo-backend/references/hardening-go.md`
  (expand-contract); this skill owns the deploy-ordering around it.
- "stop konseputo" / "normal mode": revert to default behavior.
