# AI bug patterns — backend `bug:`/`arch:` catalog

Not general bug-hunting. These are patterns AI-generated code produces
*systematically* — documented in academic studies, empirical corpus analysis,
and real incident writeups — because they're syntactically valid and
"look right" without the concurrent-access/lifecycle/failure-mode reasoning
a human reviewer applies by habit. Six of the entries below are confirmed
against this suite's own real project history, marked
**Seen in production**.

Frontend AI-bug/perf patterns: `ai-bug-patterns-fe.md`.

## BE — `bug:` (correctness, catchable from a diff)

### Concurrency

**Struct with a lock/channel/slice field passed by value.** A method on
`Publisher` (holding `sync.Mutex`, a `chan`, or a `sync.WaitGroup`) has a
value receiver, or the struct is copied into a goroutine/closure. The copy's
mutex is a different mutex — no mutual exclusion at all, silently.
*Fix:* pointer receiver, pass `*Publisher`.

**Mutation without a lock where a concurrent reader exists.** A method
writes to a shared map/slice/field; another method (called from a different
goroutine — an HTTP handler, a consumer loop) reads the same state with no
`RLock`/`Lock`. Passes single-threaded tests, races under load.
*Fix:* `-race` in CI catches this deterministically if the racing paths are
actually exercised together in a test — write one that does.

**Channel with no consumer.** A `select` sends on a channel with only a
`default:` branch and nothing ever reads it — data silently dropped, not
queued, not erred.
*Fix:* an explicit `for range ch` consumer, or return an error instead of
silently discarding.

**TOCTOU — read-then-write as two separate calls.** `GetRecent(id)` →
`if nil { Save(id) }` as two operations under concurrent access: two
callers can both see `nil` and both `Save`, creating a duplicate the
single-object model didn't expect.
*Fix:* one atomic operation under one lock (`GetOrCreate`), or a DB unique
constraint that makes the second write fail loudly instead of silently
duplicating.

**Goroutine with no lifecycle.** `go someFunc()` fired with no `context`,
no `errgroup`, no `WaitGroup` — on graceful shutdown the goroutine's result
(including its error) is simply dropped; the caller has no way to wait for
or cancel it.
*Fix:* propagate `ctx`, coordinate through `errgroup.WithContext` when the
result matters, or explicitly document the fire-and-forget with a `konseputo:`
marker naming why it's safe to lose.

**Unbounded goroutine-per-item / goroutine-per-request.** A loop over an
incoming batch (Kafka message, HTTP payload, queue drain) spawns one
goroutine per item with no cap. Fine at low volume; under a burst (retry
storm, backfill job) goroutines pile up faster than they drain, each
holding a stack and often a blocked DB connection, until the process OOMs.
*Fix:* bounded worker pool or a semaphore (`make(chan struct{}, N)`).

**Seen in production:** RAG pipeline code lacked `errgroup` —
concurrent calls had no coordinated error handling or cancellation
propagation; fixed in the sprint-3 security/reliability wave.

**`context.With*` with no `defer cancel()` on the next line.** Leaks the
timer/goroutine behind it. *Fix:* `defer cancel()` immediately, no
exceptions. Full detail: `../../konseputo-backend/references/hardening-go.md`.

**`context.Background()` swapped in inside a spawned goroutine.** Disconnects
the goroutine from cancellation — it parks on `ctx.Done()` forever. *Fix:*
forward the live request context. Full detail:
`../../konseputo-backend/references/hardening-go.md`.

**gRPC client call built on `context.Background()`/`context.TODO()`
instead of forwarding the inbound handler's `ctx`.** Silently breaks
deadline propagation for that hop and everything downstream of it. *Fix:*
forward the inbound `ctx`. Full detail:
`../../konseputo-backend/references/hardening-go.md`.

**Goroutine spawned inside a handler with no recover of its own.** A panic
in a spawned goroutine does not propagate to the parent — it kills the
whole process. *Fix:* every spawned goroutine that can panic needs its own
`recover()`. Full detail: `../../konseputo-backend/references/hardening-go.md`.

### Async runtime (Python)

**`async def` handler containing a blocking call with zero `await`s.** A
sync DB driver, `requests`, or `time.sleep()` inside an `async def` stalls
the entire event loop — every concurrent request on that worker, not just
the caller. Signature: CPU at 50-60%, p95/p99 spiking into seconds,
throughput flat despite rising concurrency.
*Fix:* async-native driver, or `asyncio.to_thread`/`ProcessPoolExecutor`
for anything irreducibly sync. Full detail:
`../../konseputo-backend/references/hardening-python.md`.

**`asyncio.create_task()` with no reference held.** The task can be
garbage-collected mid-execution — a confirmed CPython bug
([#91887](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91887)), worse since
3.12. *Fix:* keep it in a module-level set with a `done_callback`, or use
`asyncio.TaskGroup`. Full detail:
`../../konseputo-backend/references/hardening-python.md`.

**`gather(...)` used where sibling cancellation or exception visibility was
actually wanted.** Default `gather` doesn't cancel siblings on first
failure and doesn't surface exceptions unless explicitly checked —
`return_exceptions=True` silently swallows them into the results list.
*Fix:* `asyncio.TaskGroup` (3.11+) when failures should be fail-fast — it
cancels siblings and raises `ExceptionGroup`; keep
`gather(return_exceptions=True)` only when partial success is valid AND
every result is checked for an exception. Full detail:
`../../konseputo-backend/references/hardening-python.md`.

### Python general correctness (non-async)

**Mutable default argument.** `def f(x=[])` / `def f(x={})` — the default
object is created once at function-definition time and shared across every
call that doesn't pass its own value; a mutation in one call leaks into the
next. LLMs reproduce this pattern from training data at a measurable rate
because it's syntactically clean and passes a single-call test.
*Fix:* default to `None`, build the value inside the function body.

**Bare `except:` (or bare `except Exception:` wider than the guarded call).**
Swallows `KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit` too, or masks failures from lines
the `try` didn't need to cover. *Fix:* narrow to the exception types the
guarded call actually raises; never a silent `pass` with no log/re-raise.

**`is`/`is not` against a literal (string, number, tuple).** Relies on
CPython's implementation-specific interning rather than value equality —
works by accident on short strings/small ints in CPython, breaks silently
on longer values or other interpreters. *Fix:* `==`/`!=` for value
comparison; reserve `is` for `None`/singleton/sentinel identity checks.

**Eagerly-formatted f-string passed to `logging`.** `logging.info(f"...")`
builds the string even when the log level is disabled, defeating lazy
formatting. *Fix:* `logging.info("%s", value)`.

**Deserializing untrusted input with `eval`/`exec`/`pickle`/`marshal`/
`yaml.load` (no `SafeLoader`).** Arbitrary code execution on attacker-
controlled bytes — same class as SQL string concatenation above, just a
different trust boundary. *Fix:* `json`, `ast.literal_eval`, or
`yaml.safe_load`; `subprocess` with `shell=True` on unsanitized input is
the shell-injection sibling of this — pass an argument list instead.

### Error handling

**Ignored error/return value.** `_ = err`, a bool success flag discarded,
a mutation's row-count/rows-affected never checked. The call "succeeded" in
the sense that it ran, but nothing confirms the effect actually happened.
*Fix:* every error gets named — logged, wrapped, or returned. `konseputo-backend`'s
own error-handling ladder (`layout.md`) already bans this; `bug:` is what
catches it when it slips through in review.

**Failure-untruthfulness.** Caught error still allows the function to
return a success shape — `200`, `nil` error, an empty-but-otherwise-valid
struct — instead of propagating the failure. A 2026 matched-control audit
of AI-agent-generated code (955 AI files vs. 955 human files, same tasks)
found this as a *systematic* cross-file pattern, not random noise — AI
code degrades quietly where human code tends to fail loudly.
[AIRA audit, arXiv:2604.17587](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.17587)

### Trust boundary / injection

Why these specific entries, not a generic OWASP sweep: cross-model CWE
studies on LLM-generated code converge on the same short list — missing
input validation, SQL/command injection (CWE-89/78), hardcoded credentials
(CWE-798), unrestricted upload (CWE-434), unchecked return values — as the
dominant classes, with prevalence 12-65% depending on task/language/model.
The entries below target exactly this list; a full OWASP Top-10 sweep is
`/code-review`'s job, not this skill's.

[LLM-generated code security literature review, arXiv:2412.15004](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15004)

**SQL/query built by string concatenation.** Any query assembled with
`+`/`fmt.Sprintf`/f-string interpolation instead of a parameterized
statement or query builder placeholder.
*Fix:* parameterized query, always — this is also `ladder.md`'s carve-out
("trust-boundary input validation... never trimmed"), `bug:` is the review-time
catch.

**Hardcoded secret literal.** A key/token/password as a literal string,
including in "just an example" or seed/fixture code — LLMs reproduce this
pattern from training data even when a secure alternative (env var) is
available in the same file's context. Not a marginal effect: GitGuardian's
2026 report found AI-assisted commits leak secrets at roughly double the
rate of the all-public-commit baseline (3.2% vs. 1.5%) — this is the
review-time catch for exactly that gap, before the commit lands, not after
(remediation detail and full numbers: `konseputo-security/references/secrets.md`).
[TruffleSecurity: LLMs are teaching developers to hardcode API keys](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/llms-are-teaching-developers-to-hardcode-api-keys) ·
[GitGuardian: State of Secrets Sprawl 2026](https://www.gitguardian.com/state-of-secrets-sprawl-report-2026)

**New endpoint with no auth middleware, siblings all have one.** AI adds
business logic and wires the route but forgets the auth layer — a
pattern-consistency check catches it: does this handler use the same
middleware chain as its neighbors in the same router group?

**Seen in production:** the media service originally had no
auth on its endpoints, and JWT-secret length was never validated at boot
(fixed to enforce ≥32 bytes) — both caught in the sprint-3 fix wave, both
exactly this pattern.

**Upload validated by extension/Content-Type only, not actual bytes.** A
file-upload handler checks `filename.endsWith('.png')` or the
client-supplied `Content-Type` header — both attacker-controlled, neither
proves the file's actual content.
*Fix:* MIME sniffing via magic bytes on the actual payload.

**Seen in production:** media uploads previously had no
magic-bytes validation — content-type spoofing was possible until the
sprint-3 fix.

### Data access

**Outbox/relay query without `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` under
multiple replicas.** A relay worker polling unpublished outbox rows without
row-level locking — when the service runs more than one replica (the normal
case in production), two replicas can pick up and publish the same row,
double-publishing the event downstream.
*Fix:* `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` so each replica claims disjoint rows.

**Seen in production:** exactly this bug — the outbox worker
didn't use `SKIP LOCKED`, replicas could double-publish; fixed in sprint 3,
now a mandatory check in the project's own service-review checklist.

**Loop containing a per-iteration DB call (N+1).** A list is fetched, then
a query runs inside the loop for each item's related data.
*Fix:* batch-fetch (`WHERE id = ANY($1)`) or a join, outside the loop.

**DB pool created with no explicit `MaxOpenConns`/pgxpool `MaxConns`.**
Effectively unbounded (or absurdly low on the driver default) — a ticking
outage, not a tuning nice-to-have. *Fix:* set it explicitly. Full sizing
detail: `../../konseputo-backend/references/hardening-go.md`.

**Kafka transactional producer's `transactional.id` reused across multiple
instances.** Naive horizontal scaling — the newer instance fences the
older one, whose in-flight transaction aborts. Looks like unexplained data
loss, is actually a config collision.

**Dependency not resolvable against the blessed list or a real registry.**
LLMs invent plausible-but-nonexistent package names at measurable rates
(5-22% depending on model, across 576K sampled generations) — and
attackers pre-register the hallucinated names ("slopsquatting"). Any new
import in a diff that isn't on `deps.md`'s blessed list AND isn't verifiably
real on the actual package registry is a `bug:`, not just an `over:`.
[Package hallucination study, arXiv:2406.10279 / 2026 replication arXiv:2605.17062](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.17062)

### Tests (cross-reference — lives under the `test:` tag, not `bug:`)

**Assert-less test.** The test calls the function under test and checks
nothing about its return value or side effect — 100% line coverage,
zero actual verification. A mutation-testing pass on AI-written code found
exactly this: a function fully "covered" by an E2E test that never
asserted on the result, 13 mutants survived undetected.
[Habr: mutation testing on AI-generated code and tests](https://habr.com/ru/companies/otus/articles/1048504/)
*Fix:* flip a comparator, run tests — survives = coverage theater.
Full detail: `../../konseputo-backend/references/testing.md` §9.

**Same-pass self-verification.** The same generation pass wrote both the
logic and its test — the test's expected values can encode the
implementation's own bug (an off-by-one billing-tier boundary baked into
both). Treat passing tests as low-signal on business-rule boundaries when
code and test came from one pass; an independent author or oracle for
expected values is worth asking for.

**Over-mocked test.** An agent-authored test suite that's all-green and
high-coverage but mocks the boundary it's supposed to be verifying — a 2026
empirical study of coding-agent test generation found this systematic:
agent-written suites reach high line coverage while killing far fewer
mutants than equivalent human-written suites, because the mock, not the
system, is what's being asserted against.
*Fix:* spot-check that the assertion touches real behavior at the boundary
that matters, not the mock's own return value. Full framing (why "all green"
undersells the risk on agent-authored code specifically):
`../references/review-process.md`.

## BE — `arch:` (decisions that compound over months, not today)

**Agent-authored fix scoped to the reported symptom, blind to its
cross-repo callers.** 2026 field data: an agent PR's actual blast radius
runs wider per line-of-intent than an equivalent human change, because
agents optimize for local correctness and don't see the cross-repo
dependency graph a human would grep before touching a shared symbol — a
hand-maintained regression suite sized around human-scoped PRs
systematically misses these inter-agent interactions. As of mid-2026, no
mainstream coding assistant resolves this automatically, deterministically,
org-wide — it's still a review-time catch. *Fix:* for any diff touching a
shared/exported symbol, treat `konseputo-legacy/references/blast-radius.md`'s
six-step assessment as mandatory, not optional-for-unfamiliar-code-only —
"the agent wrote it, so it must already know the callers" is exactly the
assumption this data contradicts.
[Riftmap: AI agent blast radius, 2026 data](https://riftmap.dev/blog/ai-doesnt-understand-blast-radius/)

**New sync call added to an already-deep chain.** A diff adds one more
synchronous gRPC/HTTP hop to a request path that's already calling through
2+ services. Two synchronous hops in a hot path is a smell; three or more
is a redesign trigger — one slow link (a DB lock, a GC pause) now stalls
every hop behind it, and retries at each level multiply load on the
already-struggling service (a retry storm).
[OneUptime: retry storms in microservices](https://oneuptime.com/blog/post/2026-01-24-retry-storm-microservices/view)

**Partition/shard/cache key with foreseeable low cardinality.** A Kafka
partition key, a shard key, or a cache key derived from a low-cardinality
field (`tenant_id` with a few whale tenants, `country`, a status enum) with
no salting. Looks evenly distributed against synthetic dev/staging data;
real-world power-law skew (one tenant = most of the traffic) saturates one
partition while others idle — consumer lag balloons only for that key,
invisible until a peak event turns it into a full pipeline backlog.
[AutoMQ: hot partitions in Kafka — a documented tenant_id skew incident](https://www.automq.com/blog/hot-partitions-in-kafka-detection-mitigation-architecture-choices)

**Consumer group still on the eager (eager-`Range`/`RoundRobin`) assignor
as the group scales past a handful of instances.** Harmless at 2-3
consumers; on a large group, every membership change (deploy, scale event)
revokes and reassigns *every* partition across *every* consumer instead of
just the ones that moved — each deploy becomes a throughput cliff that gets
worse as the group grows. Switch to `CooperativeStickyAssignor` before the
group is large, not after the first bad deploy. Detail: `events.md` §6.

**Schema migration landing in the same PR/deploy as the code that depends
on it.** During a rolling deploy, old and new binaries run against the
same schema simultaneously (N/N-1). A migration that renames/drops a
column or adds a non-nullable constraint with no default, shipped in the
same deploy as code assuming the new shape, breaks whichever version isn't
written for that exact schema state — even though each half looks correct
reviewed alone. *Fix:* expand/backfill/contract across separate deploys.
Detail: `../../konseputo-backend/references/hardening-go.md`.

**New service scoped to one CRUD endpoint or one function.** The
nanoservice trap — each one is a small win short-term; the network-call
overhead and operational cost (deploy, on-call, observability surface)
compound linearly with service count until it exceeds team capacity.
Cross-reference: `konseputo-backend/references/boundaries.md`'s anti-nanoservice
table already blocks the merge-signal version of this; `arch:` is the
review-time catch for a *newly proposed* nanoservice before it ships.
[Segment: Goodbye Microservices — reversed course after exploding defect
rate and falling velocity](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/developers/best-practices/goodbye-microservices)

**Services split along file/CRUD lines with no domain or ownership boundary
behind the split ("networked monolith").** Splitting buys the network-call
tax (latency, partial failure, deploy/on-call surface) without buying the
isolation splitting is supposed to buy, because nothing was actually
decoupled — one bug traced through 50 services across 12 teams before
regrouping into domain-owned services cut integration time 3 days to 3
hours (Uber DOMA). *Fix:* group by domain/ownership before splitting by file.
[Uber: Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture](https://www.uber.com/en-NL/blog/microservice-architecture/)

**Many services sharing one unisolated piece of infra ("shared-infra blast
radius").** A scale-up misconfiguration on one shared Cassandra cluster
cascaded into an outage across every dependent service bank-wide (Monzo
2019). Service count isn't the only proliferation risk — infra shared
without a blast-radius boundary turns one ordinary change into a
company-wide incident.
[Monzo: Why Monzo wasn't working on July 29th](https://monzo.com/blog/2019/09/08/why-monzo-wasnt-working-on-july-29th)

**Fixed-TTL cache read on a known-hot key, no jitter.** Synchronized
expiry across many cached entries (or many replicas caching the same key)
means simultaneous mass expiry under load — every request misses cache at
once and hammers the DB together (cache stampede / thundering herd on
hot-key expiry).
[Redis: how to tame the thundering herd](https://redis.io/blog/how-to-tame-the-thundering-herd-problem/)
*Fix:* jittered TTL, or a mutex/singleflight around the cache-miss fetch so
only one request repopulates.

**Duplicated block that should call an existing function (churn signal),
seen at rising rate specifically in AI-assisted commits.** This is the
`over:reuse` rung's evidence base, updated: a 2026 follow-up (623M changes,
2023-2026) found within-commit copy/paste up 41%, duplicated-block commits
up roughly 10x over two years, and cross-file function calls (the reuse
signal) down 35% — 2024 was the first year on record where copy/paste
exceeded refactored ("moved") code. Code churn itself rose from a 3.3%
pre-AI baseline to 7.1%. *Fix:* same as `over:reuse` — call the existing
function, don't duplicate the block; flag it even when the duplicate
"looks fine" in isolation, since the decay is cross-commit, not visible in
one diff.
[GitClear 2026: the maintainability gap](https://www.gitclear.com/the_ai_code_quality_maintainability_gap)

**Env-specific value hardcoded instead of sourced from config/IaC.** A
manual edit that only exists in one environment's running config, with no
corresponding commit. Invisible day one; over months, staging stops
resembling prod, tests give false confidence, and outages happen only
where nobody's watching.
