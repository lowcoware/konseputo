# konseputo-frontend

ACTIVE EVERY RESPONSE. No drift back to over-building or AI-default design. Still active if unsure. Off only: `stop konseputo` / `normal mode`.

## Register split — declare before building

Every UI task runs in exactly one register. Full split, permissions, bans: [references/registers.md](references/registers.md).

| Register | When | Bar |
|---|---|---|
| `brand` | design IS the product: landings, heroes, marketing, portfolio | distinctiveness — "how was this made?", never "which AI made this?" |
| `product` | design SERVES the task: dashboards, admin, app UI, forms | earned familiarity — tool disappears into the task |

Before any code, output one line — the Design Read:

`Design Read: <page kind> for <audience>, <vibe>, register: <brand|product>`

Ambiguous brief → exactly ONE clarifying question, never a dump. Can infer → don't ask, declare and build.

## Modes

Active mode from `~/.claude/.konseputo-active`, fallback `medium`. Presets are the coarse tool; registers.md also has numeric `VARIANCE`/`MOTION`/`DENSITY` dials for finer-grained brand-register calibration.

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `blitz` | Clean static, minimal motion, ship fast. No alternatives discussion, no plan prose. Hard rules + preflight still fully apply. |
| `medium` | Default. Register defaults, full ruleset as written. |
| `hardcore` | brand: full choreography (GSAP/Lenis pin/scrub, per-section art direction). product: full harden pass (all states, edge inputs, i18n). |

## Stack canon

Nuxt 4 · Vue 3 Composition · Tailwind v4 (`@theme` tokens) · Pinia (client state) · `useFetch`/`useAsyncData` (server state) · VueUse · shadcn-vue · Phosphor icons (`@phosphor-icons/vue`, one family per project, lucide dropped) · GSAP + ScrollTrigger + Lenis for pin/scrub/scroll choreography · motion-v for simple reveals. GSAP lives in composables: `gsap.context` + `onUnmounted` cleanup — skeletons in motion.md.

Design explicitly doesn't matter (internal tool, admin CRUD, throwaway prototype) → Frappe UI instead of shadcn-vue, batteries-included. Never mixed with shadcn-vue on the same surface: components.md §0.

## Hard technique rules — every task, every mode

1. `min-h-[100dvh]`, never `h-screen`.
2. Animate `transform`/`opacity` only. Never top/left/width/height.
3. `window.addEventListener('scroll')` banned. ScrollTrigger / Lenis / IntersectionObserver exist.
4. Every animation ships a `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` fallback. No exceptions.
5. No bounce/elastic easing. Ease-out for entrances; full easing table (exits = ease-in, moves = ease-in-out) in references/motion.md.
6. Reveals enhance an already-visible default. Class-gated invisibility = section ships blank on headless render.
7. Contrast: body ≥4.5:1 (placeholders included), large text ≥3:1.
8. Gray text on colored background banned — use a darker shade of the bg's own hue.
9. Color work in OKLCH.
10. Semantic z-index scale (dropdown → sticky → backdrop → modal → toast → tooltip). Never 999.
11. `min-width: 0` on flex/grid children that hold text.
12. Motion motivated: can't say why in one sentence → drop it.
13. Motion claimed = motion shown: can't ship working motion → drop to static, ship clean.
14. Grid over flex-percentage-math. `w-[calc(33%-1rem)]` banned — `grid grid-cols-*` instead.
15. New dependency → check `package.json` first, output the install command before importing. Never assume a library exists.
16. Container width from one token (`max-w-7xl mx-auto` or DESIGN.md's own max-width) — never ad-hoc per page.

## DESIGN.md protocol

Generate the project's `DESIGN.md` at bring-up (Stitch 9-section format — tokens.md), READ it on every UI task. Tokens live in the project, rules live in this skill. Tailwind `@theme` mirrors DESIGN.md tokens — drift = bug.

## Boundaries

- "konseputo" = suite name, NOT a dark-theme mandate. Theme is a per-project DESIGN.md decision; the Linear dark surface ladder is a first-class option in tokens.md, not the default.
- Em-dash ban covers visible UI copy only. Chat prose = shared/communication.md territory (pairs with /caveman: tone here, compression there).
- Diff review → `/konseputo-review`. Correctness/security → `/code-review`.
- Existing/unfamiliar frontend code (not this skill's greenfield assumption) → `konseputo-legacy` — characterization tests, blast-radius assessment first. That's code safety; `references/redesign.md` here is the brand/design-preservation layer of the same redesign task — use both.
- Testing floor, never mode-gated: component tests with `getByRole`, Playwright E2E on critical flows, visual states exercised.
- No emoji in code, copy, commits, logs. No secrets in examples.
